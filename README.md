Hey Everyone!
Welcome to our new and hopefully last Github repository (as of 2016/04/13)

I made this repo differently to all the others and it is still sort of connected to Baystation. This means we should be able to cherry-pick all updates Baystation release from now on.
Each time we do this things will probably break so here's some tips to reduce the work we have to do for new updates:

Do not edit Baystation sprite files, make new sprite files, we'll probably have a global SoapStation one somewhere.

When commited maps there is a script you can run called clean_map_git.sh inside \tools\mapmerge
Let me know if you need help doing that because it's really useful.

Good luck!
